    <h1>The Capuchin Monkey!</h1>
    
    <p>
        The Capuchin Monkey is a group of small monkeys with long tails that can wrap around trees.
        Capuchin monkeys are really cool animals, they have a noticable sense of fairness and commonly avoid others that are selfish.
        Capuchin monkeys are very smart animals. They are actually the first non-ape primate to be obeserved using tools in the wild.
        They also have some weird ways of socializing like urine washing. They pee on their hands and use it to wash their feet or calm down
        an agressive friend. As far as mating goes its identical to how humans flirt. The females throw rocks at the males to show they like them (makes sense right).
        The International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists that there are 17 species of capuchin monkeys. Of those species, more than half are in serious trouble of extinction.
        The threats to these monkeys are habitat loss, hunting for meat, and pet trade.
